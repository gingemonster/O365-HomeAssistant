# Office 365 Integration for Home Assistant

*This is a fork of the original integration by @PTST which has now been archived. Primarily this is to enable it to still run on Home Assistant for my own usage, but I have also added a Logo and link to this github for the HACS required wheel in the core brand and wheel repositories.*

*If issues are identified I will endeavour to fix, but I do not plan to add extra functionality. If someone wishes to take on full support, then they would be welcome to change the references within core Home Assistant.*

This integration enables
1. Getting calendar events from O365.
2. Sending emails via the notify.o365_email service.
3. Getting emails from your inbox.

This project would not be possible without the wonderful [python-o365 project](https://github.com/O365/python-o365).

# Installation

## Getting the client id and client secret
To allow authentication you first need to register your application at Azure App Registrations.

Login at [Azure Portal (App Registrations)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)

Create a new App Registration. Give it a name. In Supported account types, choose "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)", if you are using a personal account. Click Register

Click Add a Redirect URI.  Click Add a platform.  Select Web. Set redirect URI to: `https://<your_home_assistant_url_or_local_ip>/api/o365`, leave the other fields blank and click Configure.
Note: if you use Nabu Casa for remote support, use that URL as the base.

From the Overview page, write down the Application (client) ID. You will need this value for the configuration.yaml.

Under "Certificates & secrets", generate a new client secret. Set the expiration as desired.  This appears to be limited to 2 years. Write down the Value of the client secret now. It will be hidden later on.  If you lose track of the secret; return here to generate a new one.

Under "Api Permissions" click Add a permission and add the following delegated permission from the Microsoft Graph API collection
* offline_access - *Maintain access to data you have given it access to*
* Calendars.Read - *Read user calendars*
* Mail.Read - *Read access to user mail*
* Users.Read - *Sign in and read user profile*
* Presence.Read - *Read user's presence information* (Required for Teams Presence Sensor)

If 'enable_update' is set to True, (it defaults to True so as not to break existing installs), then the follow permissions are also required:
* Calendars.ReadWrite - *Read and write user calendars*
* Mail.ReadWrite - *Read and write access to user mail*
* Mail.Send - *Send mail as a user*

### example o365_calendar.yaml:
```yaml
- cal_id: xxxx
  entities:
  - device_id: work_calendar
    end_offset: 24
    name: My Work Calendar
    start_offset: 0
    track: true

- cal_id: xxxx
  entities:
  - device_id: birthdays
    end_offset: 24
    name: Birthdays
    start_offset: 0
    track: true
```

## Authentication.
### Default auth flow.
After setting up configuration.yaml and restarting home assistant a persisten notification will be created.
1. Click on this notification.
2. Click the "Link O365 account" link.
3. Login on the microsoft page; when prompted, authorize the app you created
4. Close the window when the message "Success! This window can be closed" appears.
5. That's it.

### Alt auth flow.
**NB. This requires the *alt_auth_flow* to be set to *True* and the redirect uri in your Azure app set to "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient" this needs to be set as as a manual url, with type web, just checking the checkmark for it does not seem to work**
After setting up configuration.yaml with the key set to _True_ and restarting home assistant a persisten notification will be created.
1. Click on this notification.
2. Click the "Link O365 account" link.
3. Login on the microsoft page.
4. Copy the url from the browser url bar.
5. Insert into the "Returned Url" field. and click Submit.
6. That's it.

If you are using Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), you may find you also need to add "https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/oauth2/v2.0/authorize" to your redirect URIs.

## Errors
* **The reply URL specified in the request does not match the reply URLs configured for the application.**
  * Please ensure that you have configured base_url in your http config https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/#base_url and that you have added the correct reply url to your Azure app
* **Client is public so neither 'client_assertion' nor 'client_secret' should be presented.**
  * Please ensure that you have set "Default client type" to Yes in your Azure app under Authentication ![Default client type img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17211264/72337364-ba936a80-36c2-11ea-834d-2af9b84a8bba.png)
* **Application {x} is not configured as a multi-tenant application.**
  * In your azure app go to Manifest, find the key "signInAudience", change its value to "AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount"
* **Platform error sensor.office365calendar - No module named '{x}'**
  * This is a known home assistant issue, all that's needed to fix this should be another restart of your home assistant server. If this does not work, please try installing the component in this order:


    1\. Install the component.
    2\. Restart home assistant.
    3\. Then add the sensor to your configuration.yaml
    4\. Restart home assistant again.

**_Please note that any changes made to your Azure app settings takes a few minutes to propagate. Please wait around 5 minutes between changes to your settings and any auth attemps from Home Assistant_**

## Example sensors and automations
As well as the built in functionality many users may want to create custom sensors and automations using this integration, below are some examples.

### Binary sensor for meeting in X minites
If you want a binary sensor that turns on when a meeting is X minutes away then you can add one in config.yaml. The below example lets you set the number of minutes before the meeting you want the binary sensor to change by updating 'set minutesbeforeevent = 2' to your own value. Don't forget to update 'YOURCALENDARNAME' appropriately:

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "You have a meeting in two minutes"
        state: >
          {# get events, filtering out all day events and those with a start time in the past #}
          {% set eventslist = (states.calendar.YOURCALENDARNAME.attributes.data | selectattr('all_day', 'eq', False) | selectattr('start', 'gt', utcnow()) | list) %}
          {% set minutesbeforeevent = 2 %}
          {# check any events are coming back at all #}
          {% if  eventslist %}
              {% set nextstarttime = (eventslist | first).start %}
              {# only want to be 'on' for 1 minute #}
              {{ as_timestamp(utcnow()) + minutesbeforeevent * 60 >= as_timestamp(nextstarttime) > as_timestamp(utcnow()) + (minutesbeforeevent-1) * 60 }}
          {% endif %}
          {# keep binary sensor template simple and return nothing other than on as empty will default to false #}

```

### Automation for meeting in X minute
If you want an automations that can be triggered when you have a meeting in the next X minutes then you can use a template trigger. The example below lets you set the number of minutes before you want the automation to trigger by updating 'set minutesbeforeevent = 2' to your own value. Don't forget to update 'YOURCALENDARNAME' appropriately. 

This also has a condition for only on weekdays between 7:30am and 6:30pm and sends a notification to your mobile device with a message that is the meeting summary, just update 'YOURBINARYSENSORNAME', 'YOURMOBILEDEVICENAME' and 'X' appropriately:

```yaml
alias: You have meeting in X minutes
description: ''
trigger:
- platform: template
  value_template: >-
    {# get events, filtering out all day events and those with a start time in the past #}
    {% set eventslist = (states.calendar.YOURCALENDARNAME.attributes.data | selectattr('all_day','eq', False) | selectattr('start', 'gt', utcnow()) | list) %}
    {% set minutesbeforeevent = 2 %}
    {# check any events are coming back at all #}
    {% if eventslist %}
        {% set nextstarttime = (eventslist | first).start %}
        {# only want to be 'on' for 1 minute otherwise may retrigger automations #}
        {{ as_timestamp(utcnow()) + minutesbeforeevent * 60 >= as_timestamp(nextstarttime) > as_timestamp(utcnow()) + (minutesbeforeevent-1) * 60 }}
    {% endif %}
    {# keep trigger template simple and return nothing other than on as empty will default to false #}
condition:
- condition: time
  before: '18:30:00'
  after: '07:30:00'
  weekday:
  - fri
  - thu
  - wed
  - tue
  - mon
action:
- service: notify.YOURMOBILEDEVICENAME
  data:
    title: Meeting in X minutes
    message: '{{ (states.calendar.YOURCALENDARNAME.attributes.data | selectattr(''all_day'',
      ''eq'', False) | selectattr(''start'', ''gt'', utcnow()) | first).summary
      }}'
mode: single
```
